# Fraude AI

This repo is a clone of claude.ai, so I can prototype ideas and learn.

## Prototypes

Make as fast as possible, just to get a feel for it.

Some assumptions/simplifications:

* No auth
* Some scalability consideration
* Claude 2.1 used for all LLM

### Prototype 1

* Single user
* Multiple conversations with persistence
* Streaming responses

### Prototype 2

* Multiple users
* Simple "functions" / integrations.
* Markdown
* Edit messages

### Prototype 3

Best effort:

* Python interpreter
    * WASM/python in browser?
    * Python in server
* Web browser
* SDXL image generation?
